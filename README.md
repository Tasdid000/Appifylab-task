Track User Engagement: Show which users have liked posts, comments, and replies, helping visualize interactions within the platform.

Provide User Profiles and Personalized Feed Lists: Each user has a profile page displaying their posts, enabling others to view which content belongs to which user and supporting personalized navigation through feeds.
